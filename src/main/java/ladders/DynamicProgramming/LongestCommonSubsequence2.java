/**
 * 762. Longest Common Subsequence II - Hard

Given two sequence P and Q of numbers. 
The task is to find Longest Common Subsequence of two sequence 
if we are allowed to change at most k element in first sequence to any value.

Example
Given P = [8 ,3], Q = [1, 3], K = 1
Return 2

Given P = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], Q = [5, 3, 1, 4, 2], K = 1
Return 3
