/**
 * 698. Maximum Difference in Arrays - Medium

Given m arrays, and each array is sorted in ascending order. Now you can pick up two integers from 
two different arrays (each array picks one) and calculate the distance. We define the difference between 
two integers a and b to be their absolute difference |a-b|. Your task is to find the maximum difference.

 Notice
Each given array will have at least 1 number. There will be at least two non-empty arrays.
The total number of the integers in all the m arrays will be in the range of [2, 10000].
The integers in the m arrays will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].

Example
Given arrays = [[1,2,3], [4,5], [1,2,3]]
Return 4

One way to reach the maximum difference 4 is to pick 1 in the first or third array and pick 5 in the second array.
