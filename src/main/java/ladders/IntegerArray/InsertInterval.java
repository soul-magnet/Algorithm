 *Given a non-overlapping interval list which is sorted by start point.
 *Insert a new interval into it, make sure the list is still 
 *in order and non-overlapping (merge intervals if necessary).
 *Example: Insert [2, 5] into [[1,2], [5,9]], we get [[1,9]].
 *Insert [3, 4] into [[1,2], [5,9]], we get [[1,2], [3,4], [5,9]].
