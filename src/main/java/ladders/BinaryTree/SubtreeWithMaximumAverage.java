/**
 * 597. Subtree with Maximum Average - Easy - Required

Given a binary tree, find the subtree with maximum average. Return the root of the subtree.

 Notice
LintCode will print the subtree which root is your return node.
It's guaranteed that there is only one subtree with maximum average.

Have you met this question in a real interview? 
Example
Given a binary tree:

     1
   /   \
 -5     11
 / \   /  \
1   2 4    -2 
return the node 11.
