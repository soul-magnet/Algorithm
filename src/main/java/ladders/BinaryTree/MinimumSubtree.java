/**
 * 596. Minimum Subtree - Easy - Required

Given a binary tree, find the subtree with minimum sum. Return the root of the subtree.

 Notice
LintCode will print the subtree which root is your return node.
It's guaranteed that there is only one subtree with minimum sum and 
the given binary tree is not an empty tree.

Have you met this question in a real interview? 
Example
Given a binary tree:

     1
   /   \
 -5     2
 / \   /  \
0   2 -4  -5 
return the node 1.
