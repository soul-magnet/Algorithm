/**
 * 663. Nearest Exit - Medium

You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

-1 - A wall or an obstacle.
0 - A gate.
INF - Infinity means an empty room. 
We use the value 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF 
as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. 
If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.

Example
Given the 2D grid:

INF  -1  0  INF
INF INF INF  -1
INF  -1 INF  -1
  0  -1 INF INF
return the result:

  3  -1   0   1
  2   2   1  -1
  1  -1   2  -1
  0  -1   3   4
