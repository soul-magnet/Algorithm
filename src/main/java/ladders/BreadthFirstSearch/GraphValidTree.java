 * 178. Graph Valid Tree - Medium

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges 
(each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

Notice: You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. 
Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

Example
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]], return true.

Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]], return false.
