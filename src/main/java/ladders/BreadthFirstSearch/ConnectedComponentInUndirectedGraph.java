 * 431. Connected Component in Undirected Graph - Medium

Find the number connected component in the undirected graph. 
Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors. 
(a connected component (or just component) of an undirected graph is a subgraph 
in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, 
and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph.)

 Notice: Each connected component should sort by label.

Example
Given graph:

A------B  C
 \     |  | 
  \    |  |
   \   |  |
    \  |  |
      D   E
Return {A,B,D}, {C,E}. Since there are two connected component which is {A,B,D}, {C,E}
