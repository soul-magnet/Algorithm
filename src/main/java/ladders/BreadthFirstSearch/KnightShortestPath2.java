 * 630. Knight Shortest Path II - Medium

Given a knight in a chessboard n * m (a binary matrix with 0 as empty and 1 as barrier). 
the knight initialze position is (0, 0) and he wants to reach position (n - 1, m - 1), 
Knight can only be from left to right. 
Find the shortest path to the destination position, return the length of the route. 
Return -1 if knight can not reached.

Clarification
If the knight is at (x, y), he can get to the following positions in one step:

(x + 1, y + 2)
(x - 1, y + 2)
(x + 2, y + 1)
(x - 2, y + 1)
Example
[[0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0]]

Return 3

[[0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0],
 [0,1,0,0]]

Return -1
