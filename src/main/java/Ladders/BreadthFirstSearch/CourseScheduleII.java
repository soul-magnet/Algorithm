 * There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
 * Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 
 * you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
 * Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, 
 * return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.
 * There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. 
 * If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
 * 
 * Given n = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]] Return [0,1]
 * Given n = 4, prerequisites = [1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
