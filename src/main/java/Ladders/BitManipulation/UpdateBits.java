package BitManipulation;
/*
 * Given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. 
 * Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M 
 * (e g , M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j)
 * Example: Given N=(10000000000)2, M=(10101)2, i=2, j=6
 * return N=(10001010100)2
 * Note: In the function, the numbers N and M will given in decimal, 
 * you should also return a decimal number.
 * Challenge: Minimum number of operations?
 * Clarification: You can assume that the bits j through i 
 * have enough space to fit all of M. 
 * That is, if M=10011ï¼Œ you can assume that there are at least 5 bits 
 * between j and i. You would not, for example, have j=3 and i=2, 
 * because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
 * 
 * Analysis: Use bit masking. O(1)
 * x & 0 = 0
 * x & 1 = x
 * 1. Make a 7 mask to transform N[i ... j] to 0
 * 2. Add M to N[i ... j]
