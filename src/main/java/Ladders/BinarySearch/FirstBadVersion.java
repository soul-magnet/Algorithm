 * The code base version is an integer start from 1 to n. 
 * One day, someone committed a bad version in the code case, 
 * so it caused this version and the following versions are all failed in the unit tests. 
 * Find the first bad version.
 * You can call isBadVersion to help you determine which version is the first bad one. 
 * The details interface can be found in the code's annotation part.
 * 
 * Example: Given n = 5:
 * isBadVersion(3) -> false
 * isBadVersion(5) -> true
 * isBadVersion(4) -> true
 * Here we are 100% sure that the 4th version is the first bad version.
 * Note: Please read the annotation in code area to get the correct way to call isBadVersion in different language. 
 * For example, Java is VersionControl.isBadVersion(v)
 * Challenge: You should call isBadVersion as few as possible.
