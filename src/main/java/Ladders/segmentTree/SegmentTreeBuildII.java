package segmentTree;
/* The structure of Segment Tree is a binary tree which each node 
 * has two attributes start and end denote an segment / interval.
 * start and end are both integers, they should be assigned in following rules:
 * 	The root's start and end is given by build method.
 * 	The left child of node A has start=A.left, end=(A.left + A.right) / 2.
 * 	The right child of node A has start=(A.left + A.right) / 2 + 1, end=A.right.
 * if start equals to end, there will be no children for this node.
 * Implement a build method with a given array, so that we can create 
 * a corresponding segment tree with every node value represent 
 * the corresponding interval max value in the array, 
 * return the root of this segment tree.
 * 
 * Example: Given [3,2,1,4]. The segment tree will be:

                 [0,  3] (max = 4)
                  /            \
        [0,  1] (max = 3)     [2, 3]  (max = 4)
        /        \               /             \
[0, 0](max = 3)  [1, 1](max = 2)[2, 2](max = 1) [3, 3] (max = 4)

Clarification: Segment Tree (a.k.a Interval Tree) is an advanced data structure 
which can support queries like:

which of these intervals contain a given point
which of these points are in a given interval
