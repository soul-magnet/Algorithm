 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kth-non-repeating-character/
 * 
Given a string and a number k, find the k’th non-repeating character in the string. 
Consider a large input string with lacs of characters and a small character set. 
How to find the character by only doing only one traversal of input string?

Examples:

Input : str = geeksforgeeks, k = 3
Output : r
First non-repeating character is f,
second is o and third is r.

Input : str = geeksforgeeks, k = 2
Output : o

Input : str = geeksforgeeks, k = 4
Output : Less than k non-repeating
         characters in input.
