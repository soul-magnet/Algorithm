 * 143. Sort Colors II - Medium
 * 
Given an array of n objects with k different colors (numbered from 1 to k), 
sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order 1, 2, ... k.

 Notice: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

k <= n

Example: Given colors=[3, 2, 2, 1, 4], k=4, your code should sort colors in-place to [1, 2, 2, 3, 4].

Challenge 
A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort. 
That will cost O(k) extra memory. Can you do it without using extra memory?
