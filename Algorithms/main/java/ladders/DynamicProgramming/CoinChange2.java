/**
 * 740. Coin Change II - Medium

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. 
Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. 
You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

 Notice
You can assume below:

0 <= amount <= 5000
1 <= coin <= 5000
the number of coins is less than 500
the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer

Example
Given amount = 10, coins = [10], return 1

Given amount = 8, coins = [2, 3, 8], return 3
there are three ways to make up the amount:
8 = 8
8 = 3 + 3 + 2
8 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2
