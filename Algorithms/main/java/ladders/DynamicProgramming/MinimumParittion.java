/**
 * 724. Minimum Partition - Medium

Given a set of positive integers, write a function to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that 
the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.

If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, 
Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) – sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.

Example
Given nums = [1, 6, 11, 5], return 1

// Subset1 = [1, 5, 6], sum of Subset1 = 12 
// Subset2 = [11], sum of Subset2 = 11   
// abs(11 - 12) = 1
