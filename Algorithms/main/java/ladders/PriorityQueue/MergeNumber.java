 * 791. Merge Number - Medium
 * 
Given n numbers, now we need to merge n numbers into one number. 
And each time we can only select and merge two numbers a,b. 
Each merger needs to consume a+b energy. Output the minimum energy consumed by merging n numbers.

 Notice
2 <= n <= 50000, the combined number will not exceed the int range

Example
Given [1,2,3,4], return 19

Explanation:
Merge 1,2, which consumes 3 energy, and the rest is [3,4,3]. 
Merge 3,3, which consumes 6 energy, and the rest is [6,4]. 
Merge the last two numbers, which consumes 10 energy, and a total of 19 energy was consumed.
Given [2,8,4,1], return 25

explanation:
Merge 1,2, which consumes 3 energy, and the rest is [8,4,3]. 
Merge 3,4, which consumes 7 energy, and the rest is [7,8]. 
Merge the last two numbers, which consumes 15 energy, and a total of 25 energy was consumed.
