 * 135. Combination Sum - Medium - Required

Given a set of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.

The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.

 Notice
All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
Elements in a combination (a1, a2, … , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … ≤ ak).
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example
Given candidate set [2,3,6,7] and target 7, a solution set is:

[7]
[2, 2, 3]
